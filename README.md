# About
This is a build log and tutorial on how to build a simple feedback looper pedal. They are super simple to make, but open up so many tone possibilities to your arsenal. All you do is plug in a guitar into the input, route a pedal through the effects loop, and run the output to your signal chain or amp. Depending on the pedals put in the effects loop, like delay, fuzz, chorus, distortion, etc, you will have infinite delay, chasmic reverb, snarling fuzz tones, and so much more. Each pedal has a truly unique effect when placed in the looper that brings new life and inspiration to your guitar pedals.

Convinced yet? The possibilities with a feedback looper are endless, give it a shot and see what you've been missing!

# Parts List
All of these parts can be easily picked up online for under 15-20 bucks.

This build can be made without the LED and DC jack, but I prefer having an indicator for whether the pedal is on.

- 1590BB Enclosure (I used a bigger enclosure for the graphics)
- 4x 1/4" Guitar Jacks
- 1x DC Power Connector
- 1x Latching or Momentary 3PDT Footswitch
- 1x LED
- 1x 4.7kOhm resistor

# Schematic
This is the schematic for the feedback looper pedal. In the future I plan on experimenting with a buffer/distortion circuit and phase switch for added versitility similar to Death By Audio's version of this pedal.

The way this design works is by looping the effects loop back onto itself. Using a distortion pedal, feedback similar to amplifier feedback is observed. Whereas if you put a delay pedal in the loop, you can get infinite delay or a stacked delay effect. Every pedal will react differently in this setup, making for a truly unique pedal that brings new life to your pedals. As well as, with the volume potentiometer you can control how much feedback is being heard in the signal chain.

# Artwork
I used Hayes white background waterslide decals to transfer the artwork to the enclosure. Waterslide decals are super cheap and easy to use, so it was perfect for my guitar pedal builds without having to outsource for graphics. Using inkscape, you can easily add in additional information such as what certain knobs do on your pedal. 

# Closing
I hope you got some useful information about how to build a feedback pedel for yourself to try out. Especially for beginner pedal builders, this is the perfect way to start learning how to build guitar pedals. This pedal is always suprising me every time I use it, it opened up a whole new universe of tone at my fingertips without having to use a cranked amplifier.
