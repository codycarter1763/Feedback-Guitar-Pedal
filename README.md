# About
This is a build log and tutorial on how to build a simple feedback looper pedal. They are super simple to make, but open up so many tone possibilities to your arsenal. The way a feedback looper works is you plug a guitar into the input, route a pedal through the effects loop, and run the output to your signal chain or amp. Depending on the pedals put in the effects loop, like delay, fuzz, chorus, distortion, etc, you will have infinite delay, chasmic reverb, snarling fuzz tones, and so much more. Each pedal has a truly unique effect when placed in the looper that brings new life and inspiration to your guitar pedals.

Convinced yet? The possibilities with a feedback looper are endless, give it a shot and see what the hype is about!

# Parts List
All of these parts can be easily picked up online for under 15-20 bucks.

This build can be made without the LED and DC jack, but I prefer having an indicator for whether the pedal is on.

- 1590BB Enclosure (I used a bigger enclosure for the graphics)
- 4x 1/4" Guitar Jacks
- 1x DC Power Connector
- 1x Latching or Momentary 3PDT Footswitch
- 1x LED
- 1x 1kOhm resistor
